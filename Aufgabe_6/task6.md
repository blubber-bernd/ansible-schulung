# Task 6
This exercise builds on the results of tasks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. And is a team effort

## Task details
* This task is worked on in teams of 2, so that both Ubuntu and RHEL are represented in one team.
* Copy the results from the previous exercise into a shared directory. You should end up with the typical Ansible structure with the folders `roles` and `inventory`.
  * Accordingly, there should only be one `hosts` file that has been created from the two old hosts files.
  * There should also only be one `group_vars`.
* Now create ONE playbook, which installs both operating systems with a web server as elegantly as possible.
